      <p>
        After graduating from Northern Arizona University with a Bachelors
        in Applied Computer Science I moved to Austin, Texas looking to begin
        my career in software development. While searching for work I spent
        a few months developing the mobile game Pazaak Cantina. I then was
        accepted into the apprenticeship program at the software development
        company Moove-it, located in downtown Austin. I am hopeful that I will
        begin working as a full-time developer with Moove-it after finishing the apprenticeship.
